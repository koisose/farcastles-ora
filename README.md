# Explanation
Theres a word based game on farcaster called farcastles https://warpcast.com/~/channel/farcastles the objective of the game is simple you either attack north or attack south, and you need to also pick a crew, so to make the game interesting i create an app where you can generate a reason using ai on why you attack particular castle, then after that you need to generate image based on that reason so i create a call the contract to create an image prompt based on the reason why i attack that particular castle, then i use that prompt to create an image by calling the contract to then call the ai oracle this resulted on a frame where you can share on farcaster and farcastles bot then will pick up that command and decide how much attack we does to particular castle this is the result of the frame:
